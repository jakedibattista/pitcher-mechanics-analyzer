            Mechanics Score: 8/10
            â€¢ Excellent arm slot consistency throughout delivery
            â€¢ Strong hip-shoulder separation at release
            â€¢ Balanced follow-through with good deceleration

            Match to Ideal Form: 7/10
            â€¢ Closely matches Kershaw's ideal curveball mechanics
            â€¢ Slight variation in release point compared to ideal
            â€¢ Good spine angle maintained through release

            Injury Risk Score: 3/10 (lower is better)
            â€¢ Low stress on elbow during delivery
            â€¢ Good shoulder positioning throughout motion
            â€¢ Proper weight transfer reduces strain on lower body

            Mechanical Analysis:
            The pitcher demonstrates strong fundamentals in their curveball delivery, particularly in maintaining Kershaw's signature high arm slot. The stride length is approximately 85% of body height, which is within optimal range. Hip-shoulder separation peaks at approximately 35 degrees, which is good but slightly below Kershaw's typical 40-45 degrees. The front leg blocks effectively, creating good counter-rotation. 
            
            The primary mechanical deviation is in the release point, which is approximately 2 inches lower than Kershaw's ideal release point for his curveball. This affects the downward plane of the pitch and potentially reduces its effectiveness. Additionally, there's a slight early trunk rotation that reduces some of the potential energy transfer from the lower half to the arm.

            Injury Risk Assessment:
            The overall injury risk is low. The elbow maintains good positioning throughout the delivery, staying below shoulder height during the arm cocking phase, which reduces valgus stress on the ulnar collateral ligament (UCL). The shoulder shows minimal signs of hyperangulation or horizontal abduction, keeping rotator cuff stress within safe limits.
            
            The one area of minor concern is a slight scapular loading issue during the late cocking phase, which could potentially lead to posterior shoulder impingement if not addressed. The lower body mechanics are sound, with good hip mobility and minimal lateral trunk tilt, reducing stress on the lower back.

            Performance Impact:
            The early trunk rotation and slightly lower release point are affecting the pitch's break characteristics. The curveball likely has 2-3 inches less vertical drop than optimal, and the spin efficiency may be reduced by approximately 5-8%. This would manifest as a slightly "loopier" curve rather than Kershaw's signature sharp downward break.
            
            The timing of weight transfer is good, but the slightly reduced hip-shoulder separation limits some potential velocity. Control appears consistent, though the release point variation might cause occasional command issues when trying to locate the curveball at the bottom of the strike zone.

            Recommendations:
            â€¢ Focus on maintaining posture longer through delivery - delay trunk rotation by approximately 0.1 seconds to increase hip-shoulder separation
            â€¢ Implement the "wall drill" to train a higher release point, aiming to elevate release by 1-2 inches
            â€¢ Add scapular strengthening exercises (Y-T-W-L series) to address the minor loading issue and prevent future shoulder problems
            â€¢ Practice "connection ball" drills between throwing arm and torso to maintain better sequencing
            â€¢ For immediate improvement, slightly increase stride length by 2-3 inches to create better downward plane

            Mechanical Analysis:
            The pitcher shows generally sound mechanics with a few notable deviations from ideal form. The stride length is approximately 80% of body height, which is slightly below optimal range for maximum power generation. Hip-shoulder separation reaches about 30 degrees, which is adequate but could be improved by 5-10 degrees for better energy transfer.
            
            The arm path shows some inefficiency, with the elbow slightly elevated during the cocking phase, creating a "inverted W" position that can increase stress on the shoulder and elbow. The front leg stabilizes well, but there's some premature weight shift that reduces the effectiveness of the kinetic chain.

            Injury Risk Assessment:
            The moderate injury risk stems primarily from the arm path issues. The elevated elbow position during the cocking phase increases valgus stress on the UCL, potentially leading to increased injury risk over time. The shoulder shows some signs of hyperangulation during the late cocking phase, which can contribute to labrum and rotator cuff stress.
            
            The lower half mechanics are generally sound, though there's some lateral trunk tilt that could place additional stress on the obliques and lower back, particularly on the glove side. This is a common source of intercostal strains in pitchers.

            Performance Impact:
            The mechanical inefficiencies are likely reducing velocity potential by 2-3 mph and affecting command, particularly to the arm side. The premature weight shift and reduced hip-shoulder separation limit the energy transfer from the lower half to the arm, reducing both velocity and movement quality.
            
            The arm path issues may also be affecting pitch movement, potentially reducing spin efficiency by 10-15%. This would manifest as less sharp break and more "rolling" action on breaking pitches, or reduced late movement on fastballs.

            Recommendations:
            â€¢ Implement towel drills focusing on proper arm path, keeping the elbow at or below shoulder height during the cocking phase
            â€¢ Use lower half sequencing drills to delay trunk rotation and increase hip-shoulder separation
            â€¢ Add core strengthening exercises focusing on rotational stability to reduce lateral trunk tilt
            â€¢ Practice "connection" drills to maintain better synchronization between upper and lower half
            â€¢ Consider video analysis every 2-3 weeks to monitor progress and prevent regression to problematic patterns
            â€¢ For immediate improvement, focus on maintaining balance longer over the back leg before initiating forward movement
